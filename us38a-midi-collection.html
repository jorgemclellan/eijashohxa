                            <p> VVVV These are all of the MIDI's I have collected so far. The link is down below. VVVV Not all are properly labeled according to the creator, as when i started collecting them I had no intention of sharing. So let me say as a disclaimer; If you find your own work here and wish it credited or removed DM me and I will take care of it. There are definitely a few that were labeled for personal use only, and some I purchased; but they have gone through so many modifications and renames Download link (https://mega.nz/#F!fx1HWQ6T!-RFsE_JsZyjTvaXc7xeaGg) Hello. I decided to sort out all Trails sheet music and midi files I had in order to share them with you guys here. The link above contains everything I found including some sheet music I bought from DLmarket. The folder contains 4 separate folders: 1. "Piano-only" which contains all the piano sheet music I found divided by games. 2. "Midi" which contains all the midi files I found divided by games excluding 
Hello folks! These midis might not entirely work with BMP but I'm providing them anyway in case anyone wants to play around with them. Some of them just manage to sound right with an octave high or low, some need a lot more cleaning but there are a few songs here I'd love to see for performances! You can find the link to my folder \ Here (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/o28mi52ka8y3evr/AADq469ENMo7TuCaUAATxNUfa?dl=0) \ ! List: Anastasia - Once Upon A December Castlevania - Lament of Innoce. I was wondering if anyone has ever put to get a mega collection of midi files for download? I recently got my Roland MT-32 working again, would love to have a collection of midi music I've finally though a lot of trial and error got my vintage pc up and running as well as my soundblaster64 awe. Now I'm trying to find some good midis to play on my boombox. I was wondering did anyone ever make a giant midi pack of 80's / 90's pc music? I can get individual songs but a collection would make it easier not to mention it'll also introduce me to great new songs. If anyone has any Academy.fm resources (especially any recent ones), it'd be super cool to post download links here. The Cymatics MegaThread seems to be dead unfortunately, but we can start posting stuff here again. Reddit , I've taken some time to crawl the internet and combine my findings into a single collection to share with you all. I'm going to post this around in various places because I believe that this should be shared with as many individuals as possible. I made sure to crawl a large variety of websites and eliminate any duplicate files (I did this via checksum not filename and kept the longest file name). However there 's a large amount of files that aren't. 
I'm interested in downloading the complete 130k midi collection dataset. If anyone from r/midi knows how to access the full archive, please let me know. The mega link that is listed on the original post is only a partial archive that goes to the letter D. Here is a link to that post: https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3akhxy/the_largest_midi_collection_on_the_internet/. a pile of various MIDIs if collected over the past year and here it is for download! https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6HqrfGCLsHAQ2J4WHFKVmxtUk0 (Shitty soundfonts encluded). Folder link (MP3/MIDI, FLAC/MIDI, APE/MIDI, or MIDI-only packs) (https://mega.nz/#F!shIynQDD!ba2ZWjh3KpLFiaIU9j2kwQ) What's in this? A grabbag of Roland SC-8850/-88Pro MIDI arrangements by Kanchi (@kancyi), who used an EDIROL and these sound modules to make the MIDI data back in the mid-2000s. These playback/MIDI files were released free on Kanchi's fansite, Falcom Music Room, which he closed first in 2008 and later in 2010; they're shared under Falcom's free-use music sharing policy. The easy way to find it is to tell Vektroid (waterfallvoyeur) on Twitch when she's starts live streaming. "What MIDI is the song, Lifestyles by PrismCorp Virtual Enterprises?" I have my Twitch account but no please. I found "Pure" by myself and now only 1 sample left to find. (Another copy paste) I'm tired for having MIDI Hunting today. I need help finding 2 MIDI tracks found somewhere at: Download but it's a large file:. 
1. "Impressions" --gt "Easy Lover" (1984) by Philip Bailey and Phil Collins 2. "Loading" --gt "BOSSANOVA.S711" from YAMAHA PSR-730 3. "Pure" --gt "gmsweet" from GeoCities MIDI Library 4. "Beauty Plus" --gt "Influência Do Jazz" (1963) by Carlos Lyra 5. "Neo Spa amp Salon" --gt "Bop On The Rocks" from Roland MIDI Demos (Bop On Pop by Bill Purchell) 6. "Newsgroup" --gt "J-CYCLE" from Roland VSC DEMO 7. "WebScapes" --gt "TJ Combo's Theme" (1996) from Killer Instinct: FACT: Try download the Geocities MIDI Collection from Wayback Machine (archive.org) and open it through WinRAR. (I copy then paste this from few days ago) I'm tired for having MIDI Hunting today. I need help finding 2 MIDI tracks found somewhere at: Download but it's a large file: https://archive.org/details/TheGeocitiesMidiCollectionVersion1.2 2 samples left before the PrismCorp Originals for Home is complete. I know it was super late because I was working on my Twitter Career. Somehow, it's now 4 samples because there is a second MIDI track after the first. https://youtu.be/R_0gsK8EAoU https://youtu.be/EkJVumCLNY0 Don't mad at me about sample hunting tiredness. I already found myself a samples from Yamaha XG MIDI Library containing ClearSkies original samples and 3 soundfonts which I hardly found it myself. Please don't irritate my copy-paste from a few days ago. FACT: Try download the Geocities. i have a large piano midi collection i want to share. they are not my own work, but they took a long time to aquire and organize, and are of high quality. i just want to share them for others to use to learn with synthesia etc. i thought about google drive but i want people to be able to search for them NOTE: decided to make a separate post for the drive link. amp#x200B; Posted here : https://www.reddit.com/r/midi/comments/acton2/ginkos\_midi\_collection\_mostly\_video\_games\_anime/ (http.
